## Brief Bio
Hi! I’m Pankaj Pal a Senior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. 
I am also an entrepreneur and chief technical officer in startup. 
Being a climate activist my research are all grounded in the idea that science and technology can help us to overcome Climate crises. I have expertise in Wireless networking, Sensor networks and embedded system. For a decade I have been investigating the applications of ICT technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT and the digital twin in mitigating the impact of climate change on agriculture, water resources and human health.



## My work and research
My area of research interest includes cyber physical systems, embedded systems, Internet-of-Thing, Edge computing,
Precision Agriculture. My major contributions as a part of my work as doctoral candidate are as follow:
1. Design of ecmomical and reliable multi-probe self-calibrated soil capacitive moisture sensor.
2. Development of IoT and WSN based farm monitoring infrastructure for food grass crops.
2. Design of CC2538, CC2650 and CC1352 base Wireless sensor nodes for farm and cold storage monitoring.
3. Design of solar energy harvesting wireless sensor networks.
4. Design of fringing field based multi-probe self-calibrated soil moisture sensor.
5. Artificial intelligence based node deployment recommendation system in medium grass vegetation.
